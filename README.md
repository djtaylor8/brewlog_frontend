 # Brew Log - Single Page Application with Javascript and Rails

This app is built using vanilla Javascript on the frontend and a Rails API as the backend. With the help of the Mapbox API, users can search breweries and create entries based on their experiences.

### Installing

Make sure you have Ruby and Rails installed on your device, as well as PostgreSQL.

Clone the backend repo [here](https://github.com/djtaylor8/brewlog_backend) and run ```bundle install```. 

Create the database and run migrations by running ```rails db:create``` and ```rails db:migrate```. While not necessary, you can also run ```rails db:seed``` to see basic seed data in the app. Finally, start the server by running ```rails s```.

After cloning this frontend repo, cd into it and run ```open index.html``` in the terminal to view the page in your browser.
